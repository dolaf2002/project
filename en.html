      <div class="bio">
        <p>Razmik Karen Tandilyan was born on July 6, 2001, in the village of Haghpats in the Lori region of Armenia. From 2007 to 2019, he studied at Haghpat Secondary School. He loved Armenian history and Russian language. He was a favorite of the teachers and the joy of his classmates, as he was very funny, friendly, and trustworthy.</p>

        <p>In 2019, after graduating from school, he entered the National Polytechnic University of Armenia. However, after four months of studying, he was drafted into the army on January 15, 2020. He served in Hadrut as a garrison soldier. He never complained. When asked by his mother, he would always respond: "Everything is fine here, we are all here."</p>

        <p>After nine months of service, the 44-day war began. On the morning of September 27, they were called to the front lines. On October 4, he was transferred to a command post. According to his comrades, he fought with bravery worthy of a real hero. After continuous firing, his machine gun broke. He requested a new one.</p>

        <p>On October 7, during his last conversation with his mother, he reassured her: "Don't worry, everything is calm here." He told his father: "Tell them not to send anyone from the village, I will fight for all of them." When his brother asked, "Have you seen any Turks?", he replied: "As many as you want." When his brother asked, "Are you standing or lying?", Razmik replied laughing, "Standing, I’m putting them down!"</p>

        <p>On October 9, Razmik died while securing the command post from artillery fire.</p>

        <p>A memorial fountain was built in the yard of his school in Haghpat in his memory, and a memorial stone was placed along the road leading to the village. In the village, a cross was erected in his memory and in honor of all the fallen heroes.</p>

        <p>One of his comrades in arms, speaking about him, always says, "He was a guy with a heart of gold"... His father often remembers one of the conversations with his son, when he said he didn’t want to go to the army, to which Razmik replied, "If I don't go, who will go?"</p>

        <p>After his death, Razmik was posthumously awarded the "Combat Service" medal by the President of Nagorno-Karabakh, the "Gratitude" medal by the student council of NPUA, and the "Hovhannes Tumanyan" and "Combat Cross" medals by the First Battalion public organization.</p>

        <p>During his school years, Razmik was a poet. He wrote over twenty poems. With the support of his alma mater, a book of his poems titled "Poetic Lines from the Depths of the Heart" was published.</p>

      <p>NOTHING WILL REMAIN 10.04.2019

        One day I will die, I will leave quietly,
        In the sea of your love, I will remain a drop of love's longing,
        I will be yours, I will love you forever,
        You will smile again with a sincere smile,
        And say: "I don’t love you."
        With these words, what was mine,
        Will become nothing, I will lose everything, everything.
        I will leave quickly, I will leave quietly,
        And you will remain in this empty world,
        Where nothing gives or takes anything.
        Perhaps you will suffer, perhaps you will cry, you won’t live without me,
        But it’s already too late, your dead love shattered everything.</p>

      <p>HEART

        My heart is free like a bird,
        My heart is lonely like my soul,
        My heart is closed like a door of a house,
        My heart is tired like a worker.

        At first, my heart suffered from love,
        Then it was wounded from rejection in love,
        My heart is free now, it doesn't suffer anymore,
        My heart is free from love now.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>IF ONLY

        If only it were ten years ago,
        If only I were five years old,
        If only I were small and alone.
        Ten years ago, I was happy,
        Ten years ago, I was carefree,
        Now I remember ten years ago
        And get angry with myself,
        Why did I grow up so fast,
        After all, life is given only once.
        In this empty life,
        There is nothing that has meaning or significance,
        True life is so cruel,
        Ten years ago, I didn’t know this much,
        That by growing up, I am wearing out my life,
        I put love above all in my life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I WILL TAKE YOU

        I will take you far away from everyone,
        So we can be alone, just you and I,
        So we can talk calmly about everything,
        About our future, life, and death.
        We will talk slowly, coldly, monotonously,
        Like the river flows through the mountain valley,
        We will be alone, we will be free,
        We will become forever dear to each other.</p>
